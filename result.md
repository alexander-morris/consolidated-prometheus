# Coordinator Repository Open-Source Review

## Potentially Sensitive Information

After reviewing the coordinator repository for issues that would be problematic for open-sourcing, I found the following categories of potentially sensitive information:

### Environment Variables & API Keys
The codebase references several environment variables that would contain sensitive information:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Used for GitHub API operations
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Used for AI model access
- `PROMETHEUS_SERVER_X_API_KEY` and related keys - Used for API authentication
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - Used for Slack notifications

### Database Connection Strings
- `MONGODB_URI` - References to MongoDB connection strings

### Server Endpoints and URLs
- `PROMETHEUS_SERVER_URL` - URLs for server endpoints
- Hardcoded URLs including Koii Network RPC endpoint and GitHub repository URLs

### IP Addresses
- `0.0.0.0` - Server bind addresses in Python applications

### Authentication Mechanisms
- Bearer token authentication systems in middleware and API utilities

## Recommendations

The codebase follows good security practices by using environment variables rather than hardcoded credentials. Before open-sourcing:

1. Ensure all environment variable names are documented but without values
2. Review and sanitize any example configuration files
3. Add explicit instructions in the README about required environment variables
4. Consider adding a template `.env.example` file
5. Implement proper GitHub Actions secrets management for any CI/CD workflows
6. Check the git history to ensure no past commits contain hardcoded credentials
7. Add clear security guidelines for contributors

No actual credential values were found directly in the code, which is positive for open-sourcing readiness.
