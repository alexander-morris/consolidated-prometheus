# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name your repository (e.g., "pro-me-the-us")
   - Choose whether it should be public or private
   - Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (since we've already created those locally)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Connect your local repository to GitHub**
   Run the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
   # Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pro-me-the-us.git

   # Push your local repository to GitHub
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

3. **Verify the connection**
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   
   This should display your GitHub repository URL for both fetch and push operations.

Your repository now contains both the 'node' (feature-builder) and 'coordinator' (middle-server) components with their respective .gitignore files preserved.
